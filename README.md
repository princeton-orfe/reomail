# reomail

reomail (regarding ORFE mail) is a mailer that accepts a responsive and accessible HTML body and can be used to send styled newsletters, communications, and releases to lists and other groups without the use of a third-party.

The tool is designed to connect directly to a Princeton email account to send the message, much like any other email client application.
